## 1. Open Source Viral Marketing Strategies

### Key Playbooks & Guides

- [zenika-open-source/promote-open-source-project](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/promote-open-source-project) -- GitHub repo with a comprehensive checklist for promoting open source projects
- [opensource.guide/finding-users](https://opensource.guide/finding-users/) -- GitHub's official open source guide on finding users
- [TODO Group Marketing Guide](https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/marketing-open-source-projects/) -- Linux Foundation's TODO Group guide on marketing open source projects

- [Open Source Marketing Playbook for Indie Hackers](https://indieradar.app/blog/open-source-marketing-playbook-indie-hackers) -- 2026 guide specifically for indie hackers

### Core Lessons

- README is the landing page -- invest heavily in it (demo video/GIF, clear tagline, one-liner install command)
- Seed initial GitHub stars from personal network before any public launch
- The HN audience overindexes on open-source, privacy-first, no-subscription tools -- AID fits this perfectly as a DNS-based, no-registry, open protocol
- Don't blast all channels at once; stagger promotions over weeks
- Solve a real, personal problem and tell the story of *why* you built it

---

## 5. Major MCP-Related GitHub Repositories

Official repos to engage with (file issues, discussions, or PRs):

| Repository | What to do |
|---|---|
| [modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) | Open a discussion proposing AID as a DNS-based discovery mechanism for MCP servers |
| [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) | Reference server implementations; propose AID integration |
| [MCP org discussions](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) | Participate in discovery-related discussions |
| [anthropics/claude-ai-mcp](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-ai-mcp) | Claude.ai MCP integration hub |
| [agentskills/agentskills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) | Agent Skills open standard -- propose skill discovery via DNS |
| [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | Anthropic's skills implementation |
| [agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry) | MCP Gateway & Registry -- propose AID as DNS discovery layer |

**Key fact:** Service discovery is explicitly on the [MCP roadmap](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/roadmap). AID directly addresses this gap.

---

## 6. Anthropic MCP Spec Repo -- Specific Engagement Points

- **GitHub Discussions:** [github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) -- Discussion #629 and others cover tool discovery patterns. Open a discussion titled something like: "DNS-based MCP server discovery using _agent TXT records"
- **SEPs (Specification Enhancement Proposals):** SEPs are now created as PRs to the `seps/` directory in the spec repo. Consider submitting a SEP for DNS-based server discovery.
- **MCP Registry:** The MCP Registry launched in September 2025 in preview. AID could position itself as a decentralized complement to the centralized registry.
- **Key pain point:** "MCP works beautifully in demos and breaks the moment you try to scale it" -- AID's DNS-based approach addresses scalability concerns.

---

## 7. Google A2A Protocol Repo -- Specific Engagement Points

| Resource | URL | Action |
|---|---|---|
| A2A Main Repo | [github.com/a2aproject/A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) | Open issue/discussion about DNS-based Agent Card discovery via AID |
| A2A Samples | [github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples) | Contribute a sample showing AID + A2A integration |
| A2A Discussions | GitHub Discussions on the A2A org | Participate in discovery-related threads |
| awesome-a2a | [github.com/ai-boost/awesome-a2a](https://github.com/ai-boost/awesome-a2a) | Submit AID as a discovery tool |
| MCP discussion comparing A2A | [Discussion #1108](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/1108) | Engage and mention AID as bridging discovery for both protocols |

**Key fact:** A2A uses `.well-known/agent-card.json` for discovery. AID's DNS TXT approach is complementary and even simpler -- propose it as an additional discovery mechanism.

---

## 8. Agent Protocol Standardization Efforts

These are direct competitors, collaborators, or adjacent projects to engage with:

| Protocol/Project | URL | Relationship to AID |
|---|---|---|
| **IETF BANDAID** | [datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mozleywilliams-dnsop-bandaid/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mozleywilliams-dnsop-bandaid/) | Very similar DNS-based approach. Authors are from Infoblox. Contact them for potential collaboration. |
| **IETF AID Problem Statement** | [datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mozley-aidiscovery/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mozley-aidiscovery/) | Same authors published a problem statement draft titled "AI Agent Discovery (AID) Problem Statement" -- naming overlap and conceptual alignment worth engaging on |
| **IETF ANS** | [datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-narajala-ans/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-narajala-ans/) | Agent Name Service -- DNS-inspired agent discovery. Competitor but potential collaborator. |
| **IETF AgentDNS** | [datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liang-agentdns/00/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liang-agentdns/00/) | Root domain naming system for LLM agents |
| **CmdZero ACDP** | [cmdzero.io blog post](https://www.cmdzero.io/blog-posts/introducing-the-agent-communication-discovery-protocol-acdp-a-proposal-for-ai-agents-to-discover-and-collaborate-with-each-other) | Uses DNS SRV+TXT records for agent discovery. Very similar to AID. Reach out for collaboration. |
| **ANP (Agent Network Protocol)** | [github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol](https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol) | Uses `.well-known` discovery. Published on arXiv and W3C CG. |
| **OWASP ANS** | [InfoQ article](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/06/secure-agent-discovery-ans/) | Agent Name Service by OWASP -- PKI-based, DNS-inspired. |
| **IBM ACP** | IBM BeeAI Agent Communication Protocol | Under Linux Foundation, RESTful interfaces |
| **AGNTCY** | Coalition (Cisco/LangChain/LlamaIndex) building "Internet of Agents" | Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF) |
| **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** | [aaif.io](https://aaif.io/) / [github.com/aaif](https://github.com/aaif) | Linux Foundation umbrella. MCP, Goose, AGENTS.md are founding projects. AID could propose to become an AAIF project. |

**Critical insight:** The IETF has an active draft by J. Mozley and N. Williams (Infoblox) literally called "AI Agent Discovery (AID) Problem Statement" at `draft-mozley-aidiscovery-00`. This is direct overlap with your project's name and mission. Engaging with these authors could be extremely valuable -- either for collaboration or to differentiate.

## Summary of Highest-Priority Actions

### Immediate (this week)

1. Submit PRs to the top 5 awesome-mcp lists (punkpeye, wong2, appcypher, punkpeye devtools, collabnix) and top 3 awesome-ai-agents lists (e2b-dev, kyrolabs, ai-boost/awesome-a2a).

### Short-term (next 2 weeks)

2. Open a discussion on [modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) proposing DNS-based discovery.
3. Open an issue/discussion on [a2aproject/A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) proposing AID as complementary to `.well-known/agent-card.json`.

### Strategic engagement

4. **Engage with IETF authors:** Reach out to J. Mozley and N. Williams (Infoblox) who authored `draft-mozley-aidiscovery-00` ("AI Agent Discovery (AID) Problem Statement") -- this is the closest thing to AID in the formal standards world.
5. **Consider proposing AID as an AAIF project** at [aaif.io](https://aaif.io/) -- the Agentic AI Foundation is actively seeking new projects.

### Launch sequence

6. Prepare a "Show HN" post, then stagger to Reddit (r/AI_Agents, r/programming), Dev.to, Product Hunt over 2-3 weeks.
7. **Community engagement:** Join both MCP Discord servers and participate in discovery-related conversations before any self-promotion.
8. **Contact Latent Space / Swyx** about covering agent discovery as a topic -- AID fits their "infrastructure for AI engineers" editorial angle.
